            <h3>Backstory</h3>
                <p>I was born on the small island, St. Thomas, USVI. At the tender age of two years old, my family immigrated to Bronx, NY. My whole life changed in 2018 when I became a mother to my boy/girl twins. I am now famously known in my family as the "The Twins' Mother"</p>

            <h3>Why I joined Pursuit</h3>
                <p>After working for five years as a Certified Nurse Assistant, the world was turned upside due to a pandemic. I started to rethink my life's purpose, then I received an email about the Pursuit fellowship. After some research and talking with my spirit guides, I realized this was the opportunity for change I as looking for. After completing the application, and lots of pre-work I was offered a seat in the 10.1 cohort and it's been amazing.</p>
