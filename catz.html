            <h4 id="domestic">Domestication of Cats</h4>
                <p id="domestic-cat">According to an article published by Smithsonian Magazine, scientists say cats have "lived with people for 12,000 years". Once humans shifted from being predominantly hunters, to farmers, they began to store surplus crops. With the crop stores came mice and thus began the symbiotic relationship between cats and humans.</p>

            <h4 id="astrology">Why isn't the Cat included in the Chinese Zodiac?</h4>
                <p id="astrology-cat">The legend known as "The Great Race' tells the story of animals racing to attend a banquet with the Jade Emperor. The Cat and the Rat were the most intelligent of the animals, but they were both poor swimmers. When they came across the portion of the race that entailed crossing a river, they both tricked the kind but naive Ox to give them a ride on it's back across the river. As the Ox was approaching the other side of the river the Rat pushed the Cat into the river, then jumped off the Ox and raced off to the Jade Emperor making the Rat the first animal in the Chinese Zodiac. All the other animals made it to the banquet, while the Cat was left to drown in the river after being sabotaged by the Rat. Therefore the Cat was never able to attend the banquet and was unable to secure a spot amongst the other animals in the Chinese Zodiac.</p>

            <h4 id="egypt">Cats in Ancient Egypt</h4>
            <p id ='egyptian-cat'>Egyptians believed cats were magical and brought good luck to those who kept them as pets. Many wealthy families honored their cats by dressing them in jewels. When their cats died, they were mummified, and their owners would shave off their eyebrows and mourned until their eyebrows grew back. According to National Geographic Kids, cats were so special that those that killed them, even by accident, were sentenced to death. In Egyptian mythology, gods and goddesses could transform into different animals, but only the goddess Bastet had the power to become a cat.</p>
